# group-project-final - AI Videogame

## Team
1. Jacob Van Skyhawk
2. Ian Taylor
3. David Moyes
4. Jake Backues

## Goal
Use a Reinforcement Learning AI model to that can beat us (but really just David) at Tetris.

## Data Set
The model learns by playing the game, therefore there is no data set.

## High-level plan
1. Run the game locally
2. figure out how to have a model play the running game
3. Build model(s) (Divide and conquer)
4. Train model(s)
